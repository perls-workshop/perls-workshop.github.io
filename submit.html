<p>We are sourcing short, four-page papers from cognitive science,
neuroscience, and AI across two tracks. </p>

<p> The <b>Research track</b> will highlight advances at the
intersection of AI, cognitive science, and neuroscience. We
welcome submissions on: </p>

<ul>
  <li>AI systems which draw inspiration from natural intelligence,</li>
  <li>Computational models of natural intelligence that leverage methods from AI,</li>
  <li>Demonstrations of failure cases of AI systems where humans or animals succeed,</li>
  <li>Datasets or environments for AI systems which target a particular aspect of natural intelligence,</li>
  <li>Papers which address privacy and fairness in machine learning, using insights from the   behavioral sciences, or </li>
  <li>Works which otherwise combine AI and cognitive science.</li>
</ul>

<p> The <b>Blue Sky Ideas track</b> will showcase longer-term ideas or positions on ways to connect AI with cognitive science. While we will not require such ideas to be fully instantiated in a working system, we do expect them to be grounded in empirical or computational evidence. We welcome submissions on: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Aspects of cognition which are under-explored in AI,</li>
  <li>The order in which the research community should solve cognitive tasks in AI,</li>
  <li>How research in AI could inform research in cognitive science,</li>
  <li>Survey papers which summarize one area of research in AI or cognitive science for researchers in the other field, or</li>
  <li>Works which otherwise propose a longer-term idea or position about the intersection of cognitive science and AI.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>We particularly encourage submissions from students from groups that are underrepresented at machine learning conferences</b>, including: gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and institution. We are pleased to be able to offer a limited number of travel grants to student presenters from these groups; if you would like to apply for financial assistance, please indicate this when submitting your paper.</p>

<p> Submission Policy: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Submissions should be a maximum of four pages, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. </li>
  <li> Papers should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. </li>
  <li>Papers should use the <a href='https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/blob/master/archive/iclr2020.zip'>ICLR style file</a>.</li>
  <li> Dual submission policy: we welcome submissions that have been published or are currently under review at other venues, including both full conference papers and workshops. However, all submissions should be shortened to four pages. </li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria: Papers will be reviewed for topicality, clarity, correctness, and novelty; however, we welcome submissions which are still work-in-progress. Papers which are longer than four pages, clearly off-topic, or not anonymized will be rejected without review.</li>
  <li>Submission site: <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BAICS2020/">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/BAICS2020/</a></li>
