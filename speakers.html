      <td><b><a href="https://cogtoolslab.github.io/about.html">Judy Fan</a></b> is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. The goal of her research is to reverse engineer the human cognitive toolkit, especially how people use physical representations of thought to learn, communicate, and create. Towards this end, her lab employs converging approaches from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.</td>

      <td><b><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/">Leslie Kaelbling</a></b> is a Professor at MIT. She has an undergraduate degree in Philosophy and a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford, and was previously on the faculty at Brown University. She was the founding editor-in-chief of the Journal of Machine Learning Research. Her research agenda is to make intelligent robots using methods including estimation, learning, planning, and reasoning. She is not a robot.</td>

      <td><b><a href="https://neurokim.com/">Kimberly Stachenfeld</a></b> is a neuroscientist at DeepMind studying computational neuroscience and machine learning. Her research focuses on (1) the neural mechanisms for learning relational structure in service of efficient reinforcement learning and (2) how to get machines to do something similar.</td>

      <td><img src="images/laura.png" width="200px"/></td>
      <td><b><a href="http://eccl.mit.edu/people.htm">Laura Schulz</a></b> is a Professor of Cognitive Science MIT, where she is the Principal Investigator of the Early Childhood Cognition Lab. She studies how our commonsense understanding of the physical and social world is constructed during early childhood by investigating 1) how children infer the concepts and causal relations that enable them to engage in accurate prediction, explanation, and intervention; 2) the factors that support curiosity and exploration, allowing children to engage in effective discovery and 3) how these abilities inform and interact with social cognition to support intuitive theories of the self and others.</td>

      <td><img src="images/yejin.png" width="200px"/></td>
      <td><b><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/">Yejin Choi</a></b> is an Associate Professor at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and also a senior research manager at AI2 overseeing the project Mosaic. Her recent research focus on commonsense knowledge and reasoning, neural language generation, and language grounding with vision. She was a recepient of Borg Early Career Award (BECA) in 2018, among the IEEE’s AI Top 10 to Watch in 2015, a co-recipient of the Marr Prize at ICCV 2013, and a faculty advisor for the Sounding Board team that won the inaugural Alexa Prize Challenge in 2017.  </td>

      <td><img src="images/alison.jpg" width="200px"/></td>
      <td><b><a href="http://alisongopnik.com/">Alison Gopnik</a></b> is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley.  She is a world leader in cognitive science, particularly the study of children’s learning and development. Alison is especially interested in how children learn about the causal structure of the world—how some things make other things happen. Her lab explores how children learn by observing statistical patterns, doing experiments and watching the experiments of others.</td>
