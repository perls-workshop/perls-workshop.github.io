   bio: >
     Stuart Russell is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, holder of the Smith-Zadeh Chair in Engineering, and Director of the Center for Human-Compatible AI.
     He is a recipient of the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award and from 2012 to 2014 held the Chaire Blaise Pascal in Paris.
     He is an Honorary Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, an Andrew Carnegie Fellow, and a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
     His book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" (with Peter Norvig) is the standard text in AI, used in 1500 universities in 135 countries.
     His research covers a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the long-term future of artificial intelligence and its relation to humanity.
     He has developed a new global seismic monitoring system for the nuclear-test-ban treaty and is currently working to ban lethal autonomous weapons.

 - name: Thomas Krendl Gilbert

   bio: >
    ​Thomas is an interdisciplinary Ph.D. candidate in Machine Ethics and Epistemology at UC Berkeley.
    With prior training in philosophy, sociology, and political theory, Thomas designed his degree program to investigate the ethical and political predicaments that emerge when artificial intelligence reshapes the context of organizational decision-making.
    Thomas’ recent work investigates how specific algorithmic learning procedures (such as reinforcement learning) reframe classical ethical questions and recall the foundations of democratic political philosophy, namely the significance of popular sovereignty and dissent for resolving normative uncertainty and modeling human preferences.
    This work has concrete implications for the design of AI systems that are fair for distinct subpopulations, safe when enmeshed with institutional practices, and accountable to public concerns, including medium-term applications like automated vehicles.

 - name: Aaron Snoswell

   bio: >
    Aaron is a research fellow in computational law at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Autonomous Decision Making and Society.
    With a background in cross-disciplinary mechatronic engineering, Aaron’s Ph.D. research developed new theory and algorithms for Inverse Reinforcement Learning in the maximum conditional entropy and multiple intent settings.
    Aaron’s ongoing work investigates technical measures for achieving value alignment for autonomous decision making systems, and legal-theoretic models for AI accountability.

 - name: Tom Zick
   website: https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tom-zick

   bio: >
    Tom Zick has her PhD from UC Berkeley and researches the intersection of open data governance, AI ethics, and cybersecurity.
    Trained in machine learning, Tom is especially interested in how to craft safe and equitable policy surrounding the adoption of AI in high-stakes domains.
    Within academia, she has worked as a data scientist at the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, evaluating the capacity of regulations to promote open government data.
    She has also worked with graduate students across social science and engineering to advocate for pedagogy reform focused on infusing social context into technical coursework.
    Tom has also worked on digital transparency in the public realm for the city of Boston as a Mayor’s Office for New Urban Mechanics fellow.
    Her current research focuses on the near term policy concerns surrounding reinforcement learning.
